## Vocational Scenario / Context
You have recently joined a web development company, Hot
Beans Web as a junior web developer. You have been asked
as part of your induction and training to create a new section
for the company’s web site which promotes the company to
prospective employees, as they need to recruit more web
developers. The company wants you to include the following
things:
* A profile of the company itself
* rofiles of existing trainee web developers
* job specifications and required qualifications
* an on-line application form
* links to web development courses
The target audience for the site is people who have
completed training courses or qualifications related to web
development and are now looking for a job as a web
developer.

### Task 1

Create and evaluate comprehensive designs for the web site which include:
* identification of user requirements
* visual designs for the pages
* alternative design options
* technical documentation
Review the website design proposals with two other people
and use their feedback to update your design specification
documentation in light of the feedback
Produce a justification of the design decisions you made,
explaining how it will meet the user needs and be fit for purpose.

#### Develop the web site
Test the website for functionality, compatibility (with
different devices and browsers) and usability (including user
testing), using appropriate test plans, test schedules and
data. You should collect results, feedback, and show that you
have responded to any problem or errors identified.
Optimise the web site, using the results of testing and user
feedback and record the details of the changes you have
made so that ‘before’ and ‘after’ versions of the web site can
be seen.

Write an evaluation of the design, development, and
optimisation of the web site. You should provide a detailed
and balanced evaluation of how effectively your completed
website meets the client requirements, including appealing
to the target audience and meeting its stated purpose, in
comparison to alternative solutions. Your evaluation should
be supported by evidence from all stages of the project to
reach conclusions and suggest developments. Your
evaluation must contain a systematic and accurate review of
your own skills, performance and behaviours and the impact
that this had on the development of the final website.
Finally, you must demonstrate individual responsibility,
creativity and effective self-management in the design,
development, and review of a website.
